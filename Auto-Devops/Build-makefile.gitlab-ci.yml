# Makefile deployment based
#
# Used to have complete control over task steps
#
# Guidelines
#
# ‚úì If Makefile is present, every other jobs should be disabled (NodeJS, Ruby, etc)
# ‚úì Makefile script should be compatible with https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html
# ‚úì Simple 1:1 correspondence between gitlab job <> Makefile target
# ‚úì Convention :
#     gitlab job: 'makefile:${job_name}'
#     makefile target : 'make ${job_name}'
